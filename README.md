# Differential Dynamic Microscopy - Python

This code implements [Differential Dynamic Microscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_dynamic_microscopy) in Python. 

Run through the Jupyter notebook demonstration to understand how to use the code and how to interpret the results. That notebook analyses images of ~900 nm [silica particles diffusing in water](http://sites.sandiego.edu/mcgorty/files/2018/05/images_40x_128x128.gif).
